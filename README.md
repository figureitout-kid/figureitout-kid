### hi there 👋 karen here - junior developer with a history of Java/SQL/Ruby/Python - looking forward to the day when these early projects equally embarrass, humble, and remind me how much I have learned. If you see anything I could do better - I welcome any and all feedback! ✌  


- 🔭 Everyone Watches Womens Sports Application - if my github is quiet, I'm working on Harvard's CS350 course
- 🌱 I’m currently deciding what to learn next - React or AWS? 
- 💬 Ask me about collaborating on a passion project crossover with womens sports - will be my next project
- 📫 How to reach me: k.reynolds102@gmail.com
